#Module land
Module land is a theme park owned by Walt Disney's lesser known brother Andre. 
Just like any other theme park, Module land offers a number of rides for its visitors to enjoy.

The last couple of months, multiple reports were made of visitors trying to get access to the inner workings of these rides.
The visitors who managed to get into the machinery of these rides often got hurt pretty bad.
Because the mangled corpse of a 6 year old is not the best publicity a theme park could get, Andre Disney has asked you to find a way to stop visitors from entering places where they are not allowed.

## Your mission
There are two rides, the RollerCoaster and the BumperCars. 
Guests (aka the Main class) should only be allowed to generate new Ticket instances (needed to get entry to the ride) and ride the rides.

- Put the main class and the rides in separate modules. Then connect them properly.
- Make sure to only export the parts to the main module that it is allowed to use.
- If everything works as it should, none of the lines under the comment in Main should compile.
